Hey Nicholas! I'm a 3rd year at Cal Poly and I am looking for summer internships, 
I've heard that Valve doesn't officially offer them but I would love to maybe visit 
and see what its like before graduation! Id also really like to hear about what its 
like doing electrical engineering at Valve, are you more on the coding side or the design side? 

PS sorry for the bare website  :/
lol
